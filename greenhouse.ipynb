    "# Greenhouse\n",
    "Consider a greenhouse containing some plants and soil. Our question is: if we add barrels of water to the greenhouse, how much does this stabilize its temperature? This is helpful because during winters, nighttime lows can be harmful to the plants within.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "Thermally, the greenhouse interacts with a few main things in the outside world: the ground mostly via conduction, the air mostly via convection and conduction, and outer space (including the sun) via radiation. To model these mechanisms of heat transfer without e.g. numerically solving the heat equation and fluid dynamics in a fine-grained multiphysics simulation (which would be excessive given the inaccuracy of my assumptions about the greenhouse parameters), we'll use a thermal lumped-capacitance model. That is, we assume that each element is concentrated and at thermal equilibrium: the water barrels are well-mixed, the air in the greenhouse is well-mixed, the plants and soil are at the same temperature, the outside has wind which quickly whisks in fresh ambient temperature air, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we simply start from some reasonable initial conditions, then integrate the equations of motion given driving forces of ambient air temperature, ground temperature, and solar irradiance over time to obtain the temperatures of each lump. Eventually, for periodic driving forces, the system should reach its steady-state oscillation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equations\n",
    "To model conduction and convection, e.g. from the greenhouse air to the ground through a concrete slab, we would ideally use Fourier's law: $$\\vec{q}=-k\\nabla T$$ with $\\vec{q}$ the heat flux density in watts per square meter, $k$ the conductivity in watts per meter-Kelvin, and $\\nabla T$ the Kelvin per meter gradient. But this requires detais of the boundary layers, which we won't have access to. Instead, in the lumped model, we use the discrete Newton's law of cooling which comes from it: $$q = U\\Delta T$$ i.e. the heat flux per unit area is proportional (by the \"overall heat transfer coefficient\") to the temperature difference. This $U$ needs to be estimated, starting from individual heat transfer coefficients which have been empirically measured by material/fluid and situation. One method according to Wikipedia is: $$\\frac{1}{UA} = \\frac{1}{h_1A_1} + \\frac{dx}{kA} + \\frac{1}{h_2A_2}$$ where $A$ is the contact area for each side of the boundary, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the boundary, $h$ is the *convective* heat transfer coefficient for each fluid if applicable, and $dx$ being the thickness of the boundary material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, the heat flux due to radiation is $$q = \\epsilon\\sigma F (T_a^4 - T_b^4)$$ where $\\epsilon$ is the emissivity, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $F$ is the portion of radiation emitted by one body seen by the other. As for solar irradiance, we model that as a direct addition of a portion of its energy to the air in the greenhouse, according to the greenhouse's absorption vs. reflection and transmission."
